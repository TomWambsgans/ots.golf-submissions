# Reference Generality 2/3 track: the forest scheme, 106 compressions

The scheme of Section 7 of the paper: 63 hash chains of length 14 whose ends are grouped three by
three into 21 group digests, grouped three by three into 7 subtree digests, hashed together into
the root. The contract has one random oracle and no domain separation, so the scheme separates its
hash nodes itself: every hash input starts with a 16-bit tweak naming its node (`tw`, in `Names.lean`).
A chain step hashes 144 bits, a grouping hash 400, the root 912, and none of them has the 384 bits of
an index query. Chain and grouping hashes still cost one compression, the root two. A signature reveals one 128-bit
value on every source-to-root path, and the `2 ^ 115` disclosure sets are cuts of reconstruction
cost 105 with at most 41 revealed values (so at most 5248 revealed bits): every signature verifies
in `1 + 105 = 106` compressions, and the scheme meets the 127-bit strong-unforgeability requirement of
`OptimalOTS/Dag.lean`. The proof gives `Pr[forge] ≤ (B - 912) / 2 ^ 127` for every budget
`B ≤ 2 ^ 127`.

| `Values.lean`, `Resample.lean`, `Events.lean` | node values; hidden and exposed keygen points; uniformity of hidden inputs by resampling one record coordinate; an accepted forgery is one of the charged events |
