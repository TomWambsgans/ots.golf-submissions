# Verification lower bound for whole-word DAGs

A 5248-bit payload contains at most 41 whole 128-bit words and therefore represents at most
41 hash origins. If every verification cost were at most 92, its pattern would have at most
90 non-root hashes. There are at most choose(131,41) distinct patterns. The averaged
signature-conversion attack succeeds with probability at least 9801/280000, exceeding its
complete experiment budget divided by 2^127. Its forgery uses a different message.
