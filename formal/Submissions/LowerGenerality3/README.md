# Generic verification lower bound: one compression

`Solution.lean` exports `OptimalOTS.Challenge.LowerGenerality3.candidate` with claim 1.
It quantifies over arbitrary oracle algorithms satisfying perfect correctness, signing failure
at most `2^-128`, the paper size and resource limits, and 127-bit weak unforgeability. The proof
lemma covers every failure allowance at most one half.

A zero-cost verifier makes no oracle queries. For every public key on which honest signing a
fixed message can succeed, correctness gives a signature accepted with probability one by this
oracle-independent verifier. A free classical selection chooses such a signature from public
data. The attacker signs message 0 and forges message 1; its success is at least one half and
its complete experiment costs at most 1024 + 2^20, contradicting security.

`Costs.lean` proves structural cost rules, `ZeroQuery.lean` proves oracle independence, and
`Proof.lean` constructs the attack. All proof code is in this submission root; the protected
contract defines the generic interface and required statement.

Run `python3 verifier/verify.py lower-generality-3 --source .` from the repository root.
