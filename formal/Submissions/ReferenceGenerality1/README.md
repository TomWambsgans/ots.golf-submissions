# Whole-word upper track: the forest scheme with tweak words, 106 compressions

A witness that the whole-word class (Generality 1/3, `Graph.WholeWords` in
`OptimalOTS/WholeWords.lean`) contains a secure scheme with the paper parameters. The scheme is
the forest of Section 7 of the paper (63 hash chains of length 14, 21 group digests, 7 subtree
digests, one root), written in whole 128-bit words.

The contract has one random oracle and no domain separation, so the scheme separates its hash
nodes itself: every hash input starts, in its high word, with a 128-bit tweak word naming its hash
node (`tw h`, the index of `h`). A tweak word is a public constant node (a deterministic node
without parents); there is one per hash node, and its only child is that hash node's input.

| node | value | bits | whole-word kind |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tc k t`, `tg j`, `te l`, `tr` | `tw (ch k t)`, `tw (gh j)`, `tw (eh l)`, `tw rh` | 128 | constant word |
| `src k` | source `z_k` | 128 | source |
| `ci k t` | `tw (ch k t) ‖ c_{k,t}` | 256 | concatenation `[c_{k,t}, tc k t]` |
| `ch k t` | `H(ci k t)` | 256 | hash |
| `cv k t` | `c_{k,t+1}` = low half of `ch k t` | 128 | half |
| `gc j` | `tw (gh j) ‖ c_{3j,14} ‖ c_{3j+1,14} ‖ c_{3j+2,14}` | 512 | concatenation |
| `gh j`, `gv j` | `H(gc j)`, its low half `g_j` | 256, 128 | hash, half |
| `ec l` | `tw (eh l) ‖ g_{3l} ‖ g_{3l+1} ‖ g_{3l+2}` | 512 | concatenation |
| `eh l`, `ev l` | `H(ec l)`, its low half `e_l` | 256, 128 | hash, half |
| `rc` | `tw rh ‖ e_0 ‖ ⋯ ‖ e_6` | 1024 | concatenation |
| `rh` | the root `H(rc)` | 256 | hash |

There are 3706 nodes: the 911 tweak words first (indices 0 to 910), then the 2795 nodes of the
forest in the order of the `reference-generality-2` track. A chain step and a grouping hash cost one compression
each (256 and 512 bits), the root two (1024 bits): key generation costs 882 + 21 + 7 + 2 = 912
compressions. No hash input has the 384 bits of an index query. A signature reveals one 128-bit
value on every source-to-root path; the `2 ^ 115` disclosure sets, the nonce and index layout and
the costs are those of the `reference-generality-2` track: cuts of reconstruction cost 105 with at most 41
revealed values (at most 5248 bits), so every signature verifies in `1 + 105 = 106` compressions.
The proof gives `Pr[forge] ≤ (B - 912) / 2 ^ 127` for every budget `B ≤ 2 ^ 127`, which meets
the 127-bit strong-unforgeability requirement.

## Changes from the `reference-generality-2` track

The proof is the one of `formal/Submissions/ReferenceGenerality2` (see `docs/upper-bound-proof.md`), copied and
adapted:

* `Names.lean`: 128-bit tweak words as constant nodes; hash inputs of 256, 512 and 1024 bits;
  `tagNat` reads the high 128-bit word; a hash input carries its tweak once its tweak word has its
  value (`tagNat_detVal`).
* `Keygen.lean`: a `Graph.Tagging` only asks the input of a hash node to carry its tag when the
  constant parents of that input have their values (`Graph.ConstAt`); the evaluation invariant
  `Tagged` also records that the constant nodes already evaluated have their values.
* `Tree.lean`, `Cuts.lean`: the tweak words are leaves of the tree; a cut never reveals one
  (`IsCut.notTw`).
* `Values.lean`, `Events.lean`, `Resample.lean`: the tweak words in the node equations; a tweak
  word visited by the verifier is recomputed, so a forged hash input still carries its tweak
  (`tagNat_yv`), and the walk of the paper passes through the tweak words.
* `Words.lean` (new): `graph_wholeWords : graph.WholeWords`.
