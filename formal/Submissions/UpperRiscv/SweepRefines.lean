# Node sweeps with cycle accounting

A segment of the specification's node order is implemented by one machine region per node.
`Segment.NodeRefines` is the continuation-passing obligation for one node; `sweep_refines`
composes a whole segment, threading an invariant indexed by the segment's remaining nodes.
